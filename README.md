# LilyDevOS

This repository, named LilyDevOS, is the replacement of
[LilyDev](https://github.com/fedelibre/LilyDev).
Even if the final product will still be called LilyDev, this
is the place where the images will be created from now on.

Currently two different tools (mkosi and docker) are used,
because mkosi containers can run only on Linux systems,
while docker containers run everywhere.
